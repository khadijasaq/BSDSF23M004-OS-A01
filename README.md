# ðŸ“˜ Operating Systems Assignment â€“ Multi-File Project with Make & Libraries

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project was done as part of my Operating Systems course.
The main purpose was to *learn project organization, compilation with Makefiles, static and dynamic libraries, Git workflow, and documentation with man pages*.

## âš™ Features Implemented

### ðŸ”¹ Feature-1: Project Setup & Git

* Created GitHub repo and cloned locally.
* Made proper folder structure.
* Pushed initial commit to main branch.

### ðŸ”¹ Feature-2: Multi-file Compilation

* Wrote code across multiple .c and .h files.
* Created a *Makefile* to compile them into one executable.
* Used multifile-build branch.
* Created a *tag* (v0.1.1-multifile) and first GitHub release.

### ðŸ”¹ Feature-3: Static Library Build

* Made a static library libmyutils.a.
* Linked it with main program.
* Learned difference between linking .o files directly vs using a .a library.

### ðŸ”¹ Feature-4: Dynamic Library Build

* Built a shared library libmyutils.so.
* Linked dynamically at runtime.
* Learned about -fPIC and -shared options in gcc.

### ðŸ”¹ Feature-5: Man Pages & Installation

* Wrote man pages for functions.
* Created install target in Makefile to:

  * Copy client into /usr/local/bin/.
  * Copy man pages into /usr/local/share/man/man3/.
  * Update database using mandb.
* Now client runs globally and man myfunction shows documentation.

Would you like me to also add a *diagram* (workflow: source â†’ object â†’ library â†’ executable â†’ install) inside the README to impress your teacher?
